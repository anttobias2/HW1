    <h1>Homework 1 submission</h1>
    <p>
        This is the <em>first</em> time that I have seen HTML in my time at GU.<br>
        One thing that I want to learn is not only how to create a website, but to make it look good as well.<br>
        I will be able to combine my knowledge with UI/UX to be able to make a well written website.<br>
        I am hoping that this class is a very helpful tool for me in completing my <strong>senior design project.</strong>
    </p>
